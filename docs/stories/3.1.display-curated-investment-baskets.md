# Story 3.1: Display Curated Investment Baskets

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see a list of curated "Baskets" with clear, visual information,
**so that** I can easily browse and understand my investment options.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The mobile app fetches and displays a list of available "Baskets" from the backend through the polygon.io endpoints.
2. Each "Basket" in the list is displayed with its name, a descriptive icon or logo, and a simple performance indicator (e.g., "+5% this week").
3. The display uses simple names and logos, not financial tickers, for all assets.
4. Tapping on a "Basket" navigates the user to a dedicated "Basket Detail View".

### Data Models

**Basket Data Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#basket]:
```typescript
model Basket {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  description   String
  iconUrl       String?
  riskLevel     RiskLevel @default(MEDIUM)
  assets        Json
  isCommunity   Boolean   @default(false)
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
  curator       User?     @relation("CuratedBy", fields: [curatorId], references: [id])
  curatorId     String?
  holdings      PortfolioHolding[]
  schedules     InvestmentSchedule[]
  autoInvestments AutoInvestment[]
}

enum RiskLevel {
  LOW
  MEDIUM
  HIGH
}
```

**Portfolio Holding Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#portfolioholding]:
```typescript
model PortfolioHolding {
  id                    String    @id @default(cuid())
  unitsOwned            Decimal
  totalAmountInvested   Decimal
  currentValue          Decimal
  portfolio             Portfolio @relation(fields: [portfolioId], references: [id])
  portfolioId           String
  basket                Basket    @relation(fields: [basketId], references: [id])
  basketId              String
}
```

### API Specifications

**Baskets Endpoint** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#investing-in-community-created-basket]:
- `GET /api/v1/baskets` - Fetch all available baskets
- `GET /api/v1/baskets?type=community` - Fetch community-created baskets
- `GET /api/v1/baskets/:id` - Fetch specific basket details

**API Gateway Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- All requests go through Vercel Serverless Functions as API Gateway
- Backend services are AWS Lambda functions
- Portfolio & Baskets Service handles business logic for investments

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Mobile App Structure** [Source: architecture/components.md]:
- Expo (React Native) application providing complete user interface
- Component-first development approach established in Story 1.4
- Atomic design methodology for component structure

**State Management** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Zustand 4.5+ for global state management
- Simple, lightweight alternative to Redux for MVP

### File Locations

Based on project structure and previous stories:
- **Screen Component**: `apps/mobile-app/app/(tabs)/baskets.tsx` or new basket list screen
- **Component Library**: `apps/mobile-app/components/baskets/BasketCard.tsx`
- **API Services**: `apps/mobile-app/lib/api/baskets.ts`
- **Store**: `apps/mobile-app/store/basketsStore.ts`
- **Types**: `apps/mobile-app/types/baskets.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Jest 29.7+ & React Native Testing Library for unit & component testing
- Test file location pattern: `apps/mobile-app/__tests__/`
- Minimum 80% coverage requirement established in previous stories

**Test Categories**:
- Component rendering and structure
- API integration and error handling
- Navigation behavior
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive design
- State management
- Performance indicators display

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- TypeScript 5.4+ for strong typing
- Expo Router 3.0+ for navigation
- NativeWind 4.0+ for styling with Tailwind CSS conventions
- REST API communication standard

**Design System** [Source: previous stories and design.json]:
- Colors: #000000 (text), #FFFFFF (backgrounds), #5852FF (primary brand)
- Typography: MD Nichrome (headings), Gilroy (body text)
- 8px grid system for spacing
- Performance indicators: Green for positive, Red for negative

### External API Integration

**Polygon.io Integration** [Source: architecture/polygon-integration.md]:
- Real-time stock market data via `/v2/aggs/ticker/{ticker}/prev` endpoint
- Historical performance data for basket calculations
- Asset pricing updates with 1-minute cache during market hours
- Rate limiting: 5 calls/minute (free tier), implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error handling: Fallback to cached data, graceful degradation for missing performance indicators
- Security: API key stored in backend environment variables, never exposed to frontend

**Thirdweb SDK Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]:
- All blockchain interactions handled via Thirdweb SDK
- Smart contract integration for basket ownership tracking

### Security Considerations

- No sensitive data exposure in frontend components
- API authentication handled through existing auth system
- Proper error handling to prevent data leaks
- Input validation for all user interactions

### Performance Considerations

- Implement data caching to reduce API calls
- Use loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Optimize image loading for basket icons/logos
- Implement proper list virtualization for large basket lists
