# Story 2.6: Create Profile Screen Scaffold

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic scaffold for the Profile & Settings screen,
**so that** users have a designated area for account management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `ProfileScreen` component is created and linked to the Profile tab.
2. The screen displays a static title, "Profile & Settings".
3. The screen includes placeholder entry points for "Edit Profile", "Security", and "Logout".
4. The component follows the established design system specifications from design.json.
5. The screen integrates properly with Expo Router navigation from Story 2.1.
6. The component is accessible and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
7. The screen layout is responsive and works across different device sizes.
8. Placeholder content uses realistic mock data that matches expected future API responses.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information

- **File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`
- **Navigation Integration**: Builds on Story 2.1 tab navigation implementation
- **Component Structure**: Follows atomic design methodology established in Story 1.4
- **Styling System**: Uses NativeWind with design system tokens from `design.json`
- **State Management**: Prepared for future Zustand integration for user profile data
- **Authentication**: Will integrate with existing auth store from Story 1.2

### Design System Specifications

- **Colors**:
  - Dark theme: #000000 (text), #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
  - Accent: #5852FF (primary brand color)
  - Danger: Red tones for logout button
  - Neutral: Gray tones for secondary text
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: MD Nichrome font family
  - Body text: Gilroy font family
  - Title: 24px, bold weight
  - User name: 20px, medium weight
  - Menu items: 16px, regular weight
  - Secondary text: 14px, regular weight
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px grid system
- **Layout**: Vertical stack with proper padding and margins
- **Avatar**: 80px diameter circle with placeholder image

### Mock Data Structure

```typescript
// User Profile placeholder
userProfile: {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  memberSince: "December 2024",
  avatar: null, // Placeholder for future avatar implementation
  accountType: "Standard"
}

// Settings Menu placeholder
settingsMenu: [
  {
    category: "Account",
    items: [
      { title: "Edit Profile", icon: "user", action: "edit-profile" },
      { title: "Security", icon: "shield", action: "security" },
      { title: "Notifications", icon: "bell", action: "notifications" }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "App",
    items: [
      { title: "Privacy Policy", icon: "document", action: "privacy" },
      { title: "Terms of Service", icon: "document", action: "terms" },
      { title: "Help & Support", icon: "help", action: "support" }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Actions",
    items: [
      { title: "Logout", icon: "logout", action: "logout", variant: "danger" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Future Integration Points

- **Epic 1**: Will integrate with authentication system for real user data
- **Epic 5**: Will add community curator profile features
- **Component Reusability**: Profile components will be reused in edit profile screens

### Testing Standards

- **Test File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/__tests__/screens/profile.test.tsx`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Test Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for component logic
- **Test Categories**:
  - Component rendering and structure
  - Navigation integration
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Responsive behavior
  - Mock data display
  - Menu item interactions

### Testing Patterns

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('ProfileScreen', () => {
  it('renders profile title correctly', () => {});
  it('displays user profile information', () => {});
  it('shows settings menu categories', () => {});
  it('renders logout option with danger styling', () => {});
  it('navigates correctly from tab bar', () => {});
  it('meets accessibility standards', () => {});
});
```

### Authentication Integration Notes

- **Auth Store**: Will connect to existing Zustand auth store for user data
- **Logout Functionality**: Will integrate with auth logout method
- **Profile Updates**: Prepared for future profile editing capabilities
- **Security Settings**: Placeholder for future security feature integration
